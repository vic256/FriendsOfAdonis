Magnify provides a simple, driver based solution for adding full-text search to your Lucid models. Using Lucid hooks, Magnify automatically keep your search indexes in sync with your database.

Currently, Magnify ships with [Algolia](https://algolia.com), [Meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/) and [Typesense](https://typesense.org/) engines. Furthermore, writing custom engines is simple and you are free to extend Magnify with your own search implementations.

```ts title="app/models/post.ts"
import { compose } from "@adonisjs/core/helpers";
import { BaseModel, column } from "@adonisjs/lucid/orm";
import { Searchable } from "@foadonis/magnify";

export default class Post extends compose(BaseModel, Searchable) {
  @column({ isPrimary: true })
  declare id: string;

  @column()
  declare title: string;
}
```

```ts
import Post from "#models/post";

const posts = await Post.search("Adonis").take(10).get();
```
